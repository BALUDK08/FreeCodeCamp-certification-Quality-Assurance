<p>The following challenges will make use of the <code>chat.pug</code> file. So, in your <code>routes.js</code> file, add a GET route pointing to <code>/chat</code> which makes use of <code>ensureAuthenticated</code>, and renders <code>chat.pug</code>, with <code>{ user: req.user }</code> passed as an argument to the response. Now, alter your existing <code>/auth/github/callback</code> route to set the <code>req.session.user_id = req.user.id</code>, and redirect to <code>/chat</code>.</p>
<p><code>socket.io@~2.3.0</code> has already been added as a dependency, so require/instantiate it in your server as follows with <code>http</code> (comes built-in with Nodejs):</p>
<pre class="language-javascript" tabindex="0"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> http <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'http'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">createServer</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>app<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> io <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'socket.io'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>http<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now that the <em>http</em> server is mounted on the <em>express app</em>, you need to listen from the <em>http</em> server. Change the line with <code>app.listen</code> to <code>http.listen</code>.</p>
<p>The first thing needing to be handled is listening for a new connection from the client. The <dfn>on</dfn> keyword does just that- listen for a specific event. It requires 2 arguments: a string containing the title of the event that's emitted, and a function with which the data is passed though. In the case of our connection listener, we use <em>socket</em> to define the data in the second argument. A socket is an individual client who is connected.</p>
<p>To listen for connections to your server, add the following within your database connection:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript" tabindex="0"><code class="language-javascript">io<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">on</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'connection'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token parameter">socket</span> <span class="token operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'A user has connected'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now for the client to connect, you just need to add the following to your <code>client.js</code> which is loaded by the page after you've authenticated:</p>
<pre class="language-js" tabindex="0"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">/*global io*/</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> socket <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">io</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The comment suppresses the error you would normally see since 'io' is not defined in the file. We've already added a reliable CDN to the Socket.IO library on the page in chat.pug.</p>
<p>Now try loading up your app and authenticate and you should see in your server console 'A user has connected'!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><code>io()</code> works only when connecting to a socket hosted on the same url/server. For connecting to an external socket hosted elsewhere, you would use <code>io.connect('URL');</code>.</p>
<p>Submit your page when you think you've got it right. If you're running into errors, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/camperbot/aae41cf59debc1a4755c9a00ee3859d1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">check out the project completed up to this point</a>.</p>
